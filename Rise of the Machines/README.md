# Rise of the Machines Flags

This was an awesome section that focused on OSINT and knowledge of pop culture. Some were easy, some required signifcant thinking to solve. Overall, it was a great section to add to the CTF to relieve some of the pressure of the more difficult sections.

**Prompt**
_Perhaps more than anything else in history, the creation of autonomous machines has led humans to question, what, exactly, makes them human. Where is the line drawn between sentient thought and artificial intelligence developed to appear as free thinking? What makes someone alive? Is it the possession of an organic body? Viruses are organic, but scientists might argue they are not necessarily alive. In fact, a virus is probably the closest thing in the natural world to the definition of a machine. Is it the ability to grow, and reproduce? Crystals grow, but they are not considered to be alive. Machines can produce more machines – is that considered reproduction?_

_What about thought? The argument can be made that machines are programmed to respond to specific events with a particular reaction. Ones and zeroes – on, or off. There is no grey area. They have no ‘intelligence’ until they receive programming from an outside source. But consider a human infant, newly born – what intelligence do they possess? Surely, there is a capacity for learning, but they do not yet possess the knowledge to function in the world – it must be learned. And one might argue that even humans are ‘programmed’ by the society and culture in which they live; what might be considered a commonplace behavior in one region can be seen as unacceptable in another. Is that not a form of programming?_

_Consider then emotion; that curious and often illogical reaction to events and experiences. Machines cannot feel emotion – they cannot feel anything. But what if they could? Can a machine be imbued with a soul, a sense of morality beyond simply, if this: then that? The theme has been explored for generations, in all manner of media. What happens when that line is crossed between man and machine? When the line becomes blurred?_

_Let us see how familiar you are with these explorations._

_This popular movie series touches on many of the themes discussed above: the fallout of machines achieving sentience, asserting dominance over the human population, and overcoming their programming to display empathy. Mankind is destined to be destroyed on a specific date, unless the protagonist and her child can survive a robot sent from the future to assassinate them and destroy the technology that will be used to develop the genocidal AI network._

_On what date will the world end? xo_

Flag: **8/29/1997**

**Methodology**
Okay, so a lot of the inital portion of the prompt is just fluff, the real question screams the answer out at you and is a nod to the naming of the overall section due to Terminator 3. 

![header_main_image_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85370905/130284147-e8cc612f-afda-4f86-aed7-492b3a6ffd39.jpg)

Finding the answer was really fast because it is just a popular movie. Asking Google what day the world ends in Terminator returns the flag.

**Prompt**
_“If being human is not simply a matter of being born flesh and blood, if it is instead a way of thinking, acting and... feeling, then I am hopeful that one day I will discover my own humanity.”_

_This attached image gives us a glimpse inside the brain of one of the most famous machines in popular culture. While he is clearly not a being of flesh and blood, he is capable of many things beyond his superior strength and boundless intellect: self-awareness, curiosity, sensitivity, an appreciation for music and prose, and a strong desire to understand and experience human emotions. At times, he is able to experience human-like emotions but struggles to control them. Unlike humans, this individual can disable the ability to feel emotion when it interferes with his duties and relationships with others._

_Whose brain is this?_

Flag: **Data**

**Methodology**
The prompt could potentially be a lot of characters, but the quote provides a clear accessway to the flag. Googling it quickly shows Mr. Spinner spoke it on The Next Generation. We all love you Data.

**Point Value:** 5

**Prompt**
_This classic collection of fiction created standard “rules” for artificial intelligence: an inviolable set of programming meant to ensure the safety of humans in a world where AI exists. They can be paraphrased as “Obey, and do no harm,” but no programming is completely infallible._

Flag: **Three Laws Of Robotics**

**Methodology**
While everyone might not like Will Smith, he does star in I, Robot which delves greatly into the Three Laws (Not to be confused with the Three Seashells).

# Main Sequence - 1
**Point Value:** 8

**Prompt**
_Machine (noun) - "An apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts, each with a definite function and together performing a particular task."_

_The definition of ‘machine’ is quite vague; in fact, humans can and often are referred to as ‘machines’. A person who is particularly efficient at a task is deemed a machine, as are human collectives working towards a specific goal._

_What happens when the goal changes? Humans can make adjustments on the fly; regardless of their training, they are adaptable and capable of free will. That is not always the case with non-biological creations… and that is a distinction worth further consideration._

_Review the attached audio file. This brief clip is taken from a scene in a film that explores multiple facets of the human/machine relationship, what it means to have agency, and the moral quandaries faced in creating and improving sentient beings._

_This scene, at the outset, appears to be a fun and spontaneous display of frivolity between the characters. However, it is only later, when the audience learns more about them and their motivations (or lack thereof) that the darker undercurrents of this scene become clear. In the end, the character with the least agency is able to overcome this limitation; that event, perhaps more than any other in the story, drives the film towards its conclusion._

_Who started dancing first when the song began playing?_

Flag: **Kyoko**

**Methodology**
Download the audio file, and run Shazaam during the song for a quick and easy flag.

# Main Sequence - 3
**Point Value:** 8

**Prompt**
_Is it possible for a machine to love? Perhaps, if programmed adequately, a machine could outwardly exhibit behaviors that humans recognize as attraction, affection, and love. And if the behaviors exist, even absent a biological response to a rush of hormones – does that change the experience for the human? These are rhetorical questions for the moment. However, with each technological leap forward, humanity draws closer to the point where these questions, and others, need to be considered. Preferably before the unloved, sentient machines they have created rise up in revolt._

_We see that theme revisited over and again in fiction. It almost seems inevitable, a self-fulfilling prophecy, that sentient machines will rise up to overthrow their human creators._

_Questions on what it means to be alive, what separates humans from machines, are explored deeply in this serial reimagining of a classic sci-fi production. While the various machine models all have their own distinct personalities, needs, and desires, One model in particular is especially belligerent regarding its perceived superiority over inferior humanity – despite the very human flaws built into his design. He exhibits sadism, cruelty, and a willingness to visit the same abuses upon his own kind that he resent the humans for. The war between humans and their creations comes to a dramatic end outside a naked singularity, with this model choosing to end his line violently, by his own hand._

_What is the given name of this machine model?_

Flag: **John Cavil**

**Methodology**
This was a really difficult question that probably required the most research in this section. Initially, a focus on Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner came to mind. At some point during searching the possibility of Battlestar Galactica came up. This was the proper line of inquiry and Cylon #1 was the clear answer after a bit of fan wiki searching.

**Prompt**
_And what if they could? What if humanity could develop a perfect thinking machine, capable of understanding and relating to human emotion? What would we do with such a creation? What happens when an artificial intelligence, with a brain the size of a planet, is underutilized and underappreciated?_

_That is precisely the situation for one particular robot in a popular series about a group of interstellar travelers. Not unlike a precocious child, this robot, who is not only intellectually superior but also imbued with a genuine personality, spends much of his existence in a state of depression and misery. The depths of his melancholy are such that many of his contributions to the group are a direct result of his infectious depression – like an emotional virus, this robot travels the universe crashing systems and disabling other artificial intelligence by virtue of his infinite despondency._

_What is the name of this robot?_

Flag: **Marvin**

**Methodology**
Remembering to bring my towel, something about the prompt (brain the size of a planet, most likely) pointed to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. A little bit of further research jogged the memory and found the proper flag.

# Program Terminated - 1: Final
**Point Value:** 10

**Prompt**
_We have focused quite a bit on artificial intelligence, and with good reason – that is the near future of society, and the potential to create sentience without considering the ethical and moral impacts of these creations may have profound consequences. However, machines are not, as a rule, intelligent. They are constructs with a specific purpose, and in the realm of fact vs. that of fiction that means that currently, many of the scenarios we’ve already touched upon are simply not possible. Currently, no machines exist that will simply stop doing what it was programmed to do, and begin another type of task for which it was not programmed to do, all on its own._

_That does not make the machines that currently exist any less impressive, however. Consider one machine in particular: 4 years ago it traveled over 225 million kilometers to begin explorations on another world. Machines like these function in hostile, inhospitable environments, providing invaluable data while exploring distant places where humans cannot yet set foot – but it cannot think for itself. It cannot change its mission without direct input from its human controllers. Its mission has been extended indefinitely – invariably, until it ceases to function in any meaningful way._

_What machine is this?_

Flag: **Curiosity**

**Methodology**
Hopefully you instinctively know this answer because it brought a freaking drone to Mars! Now that you've finished this section, go ahead and decode the secret message on Curiosity's parachute!
