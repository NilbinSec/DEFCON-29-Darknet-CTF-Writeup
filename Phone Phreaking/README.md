# Phone Phreaking Flags

This section only had a single puzzle, perhaps in the future it will have more that have to do with simulation of old school phone phreaking equipment like Blue Boxes etc. It would have been amazing if contestants had to dial in and actually provide some form of trunking codes to get a flag.

# CallerID Spoofing
**Point Value:** 10

**Prompt**
_A lot of people put too much trust in CallerID to properly identify who is calling. Unfortunately, CallerID is very easily forged; when CallerID is spoofed, it is easy to abuse your trust of CallerID and extend the trust of the caller, which boosts the likelihood of social engineering attacks succeeding._

_Call 702-329-2225, spoofing your CallerID as 702-555-3237. This number only accepts calls from that CallerID, all others will receive a busy signal. If you have your own VoIP provider, you can typically spoof your CallerID in your settings; if you donâ€™t, there are a number of services available that provide CallerID spoofing._

**Methodology**
There are paid apps online that can perform a CallerID spoof, but after a bit of searching, this website performs it for free: https://myphonerobot.com/. To use it however you do have to provide your real phone number. There are some VOIP systems that can fake CallerID if you are concerned about leaking your own phone number from an OPSEC standpoint.
