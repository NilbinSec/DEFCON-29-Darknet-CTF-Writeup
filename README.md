<b> DEFCON29 Darknet CTF Writeup</b>



This repo covers NilbinSec's participation in the Darknet CTF during Defcon 29. Darknet's focus is on building the skills of participants and this CTF offered a wide range of challenges across the entire spectrum of activities Defcon is known for. Some of the problems were very simple while others posed significant challenges that went unsolved by all members of NilbinSec.

# CTF Components
The CTF was broken into the following sections with specific section write-ups in the listed folders:

**1. Analog Electronics 101**

**2. Analog Electronics 102**

**3. Analog Electronics 103**

**4. Casefile**

**5. Coding - Computer Math**

**6. Crypto**

**7. Data Manipulation**

**8. Decode**

**9. InfoSec - Reverse Engineering - File Formats**

**10. Operating Systems - Linux**

**11. Phone Phreaking**

**12. Rise of the Machines**

**13. Rorschach**

**14. Strange Signals**

**15. Web Exploitation^**

**16. Web Recon**

_^Web Exploitation Flags we solved after the conclusion of the CTF_

Additionally, Infosec - Reverse Engineering - Digital Logic, Reverse Engineering with Ghidra, and Krux's DC27 Badge Challenge were part of the CTF but were not attempted during the CTF.

Nilbin_Sec is a recently formed hacker group formed out of some of the hardcore fans of Nathan Barnatt's Pseudo-Alternate Reality Game character Dad. Currently we focus our pursuits on OSINT, cryptography, web exploitation, and custom hardware hacking. We can be reached at: nilbinsec (at) gmail (dot) com.
